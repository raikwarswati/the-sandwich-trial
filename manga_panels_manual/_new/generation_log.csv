Style: Colorful manga panel in cinematic layout. Bold ink work, expressive faces, high detail. Crosshatching used for shading and depth. High-contrast dramatic lighting for emotional tension.

Scene Description: A bustling street in a Canadian city, inspired by multicultural neighborhoods like Kensington Market or Granville Island. Storefronts and food stalls are everywhere — tacos, sushi, falafel, poutine — all visually distinct. The mood is celebratory and vibrant, with motion lines and crowd density emphasized in the background.

In the center of the panel, standing tall and proud like a local celebrity, is a cartoon-style anthropomorphic hotdog. It has big expressive eyes, a joyful grin, gloves, and shiny boots. It's posing like a mascot. Above it is a bold banner stretched between poles that reads:
“Serving Happiness Since 1926”

Kids and families are surrounding the hotdog with excitement — waving, smiling, holding balloons, pointing cameras. The crowd is diverse and happy, drawn with warm, soft linework and joyful facial expressions. Some children are even holding tiny hotdog plush toys.

On the sides of the street are three elite food groups — a sushi roll, a taco, and a sandwich — each one drawn with exaggerated swagger and “cool guy” energy. They wear cartoon sunglasses, lean against food trucks, and look smugly at the hotdog from afar. Their body language suggests superiority or subtle mocking.

Above the scene, a futuristic drone hovers directly over the hotdog’s head. The drone has a glowing red spotlight focused downward, illuminating the hotdog’s face in a dramatic contrast. It projects a holographic warning sign in glitchy typeface:
“CATEGORY UNCLEAR — SUSPECT FOUND”

The drone’s presence darkens the upper portion of the panel. The hotdog looks slightly confused, but still holds a smile. People around are still cheering, unaware of the surveillance.
